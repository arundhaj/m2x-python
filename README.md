# AT&T's M2X Python Client

[AT&T M2X](http://m2x.att.com) is a cloud-based fully managed time-series data storage service for network connected machine-to-machine (M2M) devices and the Internet of Things (IoT). 

The [AT&T M2X API](https://m2x.att.com/developer/documentation/overview) provides all the needed operations and methods to connect your devices to AT&T's M2X service. This library aims to provide a simple wrapper to interact with the AT&T M2X API for [Python](https://www.python.org). Refer to the [Glossary of Terms](https://m2x.att.com/developer/documentation/glossary) to understand the nomenclature used throughout this documentation.

Getting Started
===============

1. Signup for an [M2X Account](https://m2x.att.com/signup).
2. Obtain your _Master Key_ from the Master Keys tab of your [Account
   Settings](https://m2x.att.com/account) screen.
2. Create your first [Device](https://m2x.att.com/devices) and copy its _Device
   ID_.
3. Review the [M2X API
   Documentation](https://m2x.att.com/developer/documentation/overview).


## Description

This library provides an interface to navigate and register your data source
values with the [AT&T's M2X service](https://m2x.att.com/), while supporting
Python 2 and 3.


## Dependencies

* [requests](http://www.python-requests.org)
* [iso8601](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/iso8601)

To use Python on your local machine, you'll need to first install
`Python-setuptools`.


## Installation

The project is very easy to install â€” the different options are:

```bash
$ pip install m2x
```

or:

```bash
$ easy_install m2x
```

or cloning the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-python.git
$ cd m2x-python
$ python setup.py install
```

Note: If you are installing from behind a proxy, `setup.py` may have trouble
connecting to the PyPI server to download dependencies. In this case, you'll
need to set the following environment variables to let the setup script know
how to navigate your proxy:

```bash
HTTP_PROXY=http://proxyserver:port/
HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxyserver:ssl_port/
```

## Usage

In order to communicate with the M2X API, you need an instance of
[M2XClient](m2x/client.py). You need to pass your Master API key in the
constructor to access your data. Your Master API Key can be found in your
account settings.

```python
from m2x.client import M2XClient

client = M2XClient(key='<API-KEY>')
```

This `client` an interface to your data in M2X

- [Distributions](m2x/v2/distributions.py)
  ```python
  distribution = client.distribution('<DISTRIBUTION-ID>')
  distributions = client.distributions()
  ```

- [Devices](m2x/v2/devices.py)
  ```python
  device = client.device('<DEVICE-ID>')
  devices = client.devices()
  ```

- [Key](m2x/v2/keys.py)
  ```python
  key = client.key('<KEY-TOKEN>')
  keys = client.keys()
  ```

- [Charts](m2x/v2/charts.py)
  ```python
  chart = client.chart('<CHART-ID>')
  charts = client.charts()
  ```

## Example

Here's an example of a simple application that will load the current time to
a stream every 10 seconds:

```python
import os
import time

from m2x.client import M2XClient


# Instantiate a client
client = M2XClient(key=os.environ['API_KEY'])

# Create a device
device = client.create_device(
    name='Current Time Example',
    description='Store current time every 10 seconds',
    visibility='public'
)

# Create a data stream
stream = device.create_stream('current_time')

# And now register the current time every 10 seconds (hit ctrl-c to kill)
while True:
    stream.add_value(int(time.time()))
    time.sleep(10)
```

To run this example you need a `API Key` and execute it like this:

```bash
$ API_KEY=<API-KEY-TOKEN> python ./example.py
```

## Versioning

This lib aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/). As
a summary, given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

1. `MAJOR` will increment when backwards-incompatible changes are introduced to
   the client.
2. `MINOR` will increment when backwards-compatible functionality is added.
3. `PATCH` will increment with backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as
extensions to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format.

**Note**: the client version does not necessarily reflect the version used in
          the AT&T M2X API.
